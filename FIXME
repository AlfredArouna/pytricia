- unittesting code needs expansion
  - handle py2/py3 differences better rather than two test.py's

- make sure i'm not leaking any memory...

- write some documentation

- finish and post results of performance tests
  - cpython 2.7.1
  - pypy 1.6 - doesn't compile yet with pypy
  - compare radix, subnettree, and pytricia

- perf tests for py3k as another comparison
