- unittesting code needs expansion
  - handle py2/py3 differences better rather than two test.py's

- make sure i'm not leaking any memory...

- write some documentation

- finish and post results of performance tests
  - cpython 2.7.1
  - pypy 1.6 - doesn't compile yet with pypy
  - compare radix, subnettree, and pytricia

- perf tests for py3k as another comparison


-----

segfault when using insert/get pattern rather than
  - indexing assignment
  - use 'in' to check presence, then indexing to retrieve
    - use prefix to assign, simple address to retrieve
  
  - use routeviews prefix2as, randomly retrieve addresses
